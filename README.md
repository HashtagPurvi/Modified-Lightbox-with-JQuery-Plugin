# Modified-Lightbox-with-JQuery-Plugin

The project is more user-friendly version of the Lightbox created before.

I have added the JQuery Plugin by Lokesh  Dhakar.

The new Lightbox consist of Arrows at both end of the image. 
Its possible to navigate between images.
The lightbox adjusts according to the size of the image as compared to the fixed size in previous version.
Also there is detail about the image number at bottom left.
All other functionalities remains the same.
